# Machine-Learning

## Overview

You are required to implement and document a practical data analysis work by using one of the
advanced Supervised Machine Learning algorithms introduced in the module, i.e., Support Vector
Machine, Random Forest, Neural Network, or Deep Learning. A report (1500 ± 10% words, excluding
cover page, table of contents, figures and tables, appendices, and references) should be submitted for
this coursework. The report is a summary of your practical data analysis work, which should address
the following and anything else you feel relevant.

• Introduction and Problem Definition

• Constructing and tuning the Machine Learning model

• Testing results

• Discussion

## Dataset

The dataset should have:
1) more than **10 attributes**
2) more than **200 instances**

## Tasks and distribution of marks

### Description of the data and problem definition 

Exploration and description of the dataset. The description should include
an explanation of the attributes presented in the dataset, the number of instances, the
distribution of attributes, identification of any missing values within these attributes, etc.
Students should provide a clear definition of the problem to be investigated using the
dataset, and specify the Machine Learning algorithm to be used to address the problem.

### Constructing and tuning the supervised Machine Learning model 

Implementation of supervised Machine Learning model using Support VectorMachine, Neural Network, or Deep Learning to analyse the selected dataset and coming up
with a solution to the specified problem.

• Details about data pre-processing, model construction and how the model was tuned
(or “optimised”).

• The definition of the training, validation and testing data.The implementation is in Python. Core scripts and screenshots that
showcase the developed solution are included in the final report.

### Testing results 

Using the tuned (or “optimised”) model, testing data is analysed to provide testing results. The testing results are illustrated with execution
screenshots. Interpretation of the results should is provided.

### Discussion 

Discussions on the significance of data pre-processing, the effectiveness of model tuning, and the general performance of the selected algorithm for
the analysis of the specific dataset, etc.
